Some code I wrote to run the first-order opproximations of the Strong Disorder Renormalization Group algorithm on a 3D Ising Model lattice and analyze the domains and scaling behavior. 
first_order_SDRG_domain_visualization.py visualizes the domains of the magnetic system
first_order_SDRG_largest_cluster.c++ finds the largest magnetic cluster
first_order_SDRG_magnetization_moment.c++ computes the average magnetic moment
first_order_SDRG_path_steps.c++ keeps track of the steps of the SDRG algorithm
first_order_SDRG_pseudocritical_point.c++ finds the pseudocritical point of the system
first_order_SDRG_3x3x3.nb tests a small system in Mathematica by hand
